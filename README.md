# 📊 Mini Project: Data Cleaning & Exploration  

## 🚀 Summary 
In this mini-project, we cleaned a dataset and performed basic data exploration without using visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. Here's what we did:  

### 📂 Steps Overview
1. 📥 Imported Libraries:  
   - Used `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.  

2. 📂 Loaded Dataset:  
   - Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easy handling.  

3. 🔍 Inspected Data:  
   - Checked the structure, data types, and missing values.  

4. 🧹 Cleaned Data:  
   - Handled missing values (dropped or filled them).  
   - Removed duplicate rows.    

5. 🔢 Explored Data:  
   - Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, etc.).  
   - Counted unique values in categorical columns using `value_counts()`.  
   - Checked correlations between numeric columns.  

6. 💾 Saved Cleaned Data:  
   - Saved the cleaned dataset for future use.
